# Multiplayer-CCG

A multiplayer card game themed after the Yu-Gi-Oh CCG (don't tell Konami).

Currently unplayable as a full game, but has some multiplayer functionality implemented. Mostly serves as a practice project for making card games in general and multiplayer games using Photon PUN.

Requires 2 clients to play properly.
